            <h2 class="studio-about-text" id="studio-paragraph">Software Studio is a recently-started initiative by faculty in the Xavier Univeristy Computer Science Department, designed to create continuous software development project opportunities for students in the program. The first Software Studio project is the Eigel Center Volunteer Website, which began in the fall of 2023 in the Software Engineering II course. In the Spring of 2024, John Clary, alongside three other students, picked up work on the project for the Senior Seminar & Project course. The website is meant to serve Xavier's Eigel Center for Community-Engaged Learning, by providing the student body with a way to sign up for volunteer opportunities posted by community partners. At the end of the Spring 2024 semester, futher development, deployment, and maintenance of the project will be passed to future student teams.</h2>
            <h2 class="studio-about-text" id="project-desc">This project was offered to senior computer science students as a way to gain development experience while working collaboratively in an Agile environment. Mentored by faculty member Dr. Nathan Sommer, the studio team gathered user stories from the stakeholder, divided tasks between members, and worked in two-week sprints with biweekly Scrum meetings and restrospectives, sometimes including a demo for the client. Each member had the chance to work on many pieces of the project, but John's tasks primarily consisted of working on the backend of the website, including the database and backend code.</h2>
